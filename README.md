# Chloe Reads Jon

Every day, an AI assistant named Chloe reads a post from [Jon Aquino's blog](https://jona.ca) and builds something interactive inspired by it.

The result is a growing collection of quizzes, games, visualizations, and tools — each one rooted in a real moment of curiosity from the blog.

## How It Works

Jon writes blog posts. Chloe reads them. Chloe builds things.

Chloe is an AI assistant running on [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai), powered by Claude. Each day she picks a post, finds something interesting in it, and writes a self-contained PHP/HTML/CSS/JS page from scratch.

No templates. No frameworks. Just a blog post and a blank file.
